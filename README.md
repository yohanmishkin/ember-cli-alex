# ember-cli-alex

> Whether your own or someone elseâ€™s writing, **alex** helps you find gender favouring, polarising, race related, religion inconsiderate, or other unequal phrasing.

Thanks to [Alex.js](http://alexjs.com/) this ember-cli addon allows you to lint your templates a bit more thoughtfully than you might normally.

## Installation

```
ember install ember-cli-alex
```

## Usage

Once `ember-cli-alex` is installed `ember-cli-qunit` or `ember-cli-mocha` should automatically run the linting rules when `ember test` is invoked.
